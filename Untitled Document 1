I have developed a simple Python code with Selenium Grid that performs the following operations:

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
driver = webdriver.Remote(
    command_executor='http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub',
    desired_capabilities={'browserName': 'firefox', 'javascriptEnabled': True}
    )
driver.get("http://www.python.org")
assert "Python" in driver.title
elem = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")
elem.clear()
elem.send_keys("pycon")
elem.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)
assert "No results found." not in driver.page_source
driver.close()

When I run the project, the operation is not performed and I see a blank page at http://172.17.0.1:4444/ui#/sessions





There could be several reasons why the code is not working as expected. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the Selenium Grid hub and nodes are running: Make sure that the Selenium Grid hub and nodes are running and accessible at the specified URLs. You can check this by opening the Selenium Grid console at http://localhost:4444/grid/console.

2. Check if the desired browser is installed: Make sure that the desired browser (in this case, Firefox) is installed on the machine where the Selenium Grid node is running.

3. Check if the desired browser version is compatible with the Selenium version: Make sure that the version of the browser you are using is compatible with the version of Selenium you have installed. You can check the compatibility matrix on the Selenium website.

4. Check if there are any errors in the code: Make sure that there are no syntax errors or logical errors in your code. You can use a Python IDE or text editor to check for errors.

5. Check if there are any network issues: Make sure that there are no network issues that are preventing the code from running. You can try pinging the Selenium Grid hub and node to check for connectivity issues.

6. Try running the code locally: If none of the above steps work, try running the code locally on your machine to see if there are any issues with your code or environment setup.








I have developed a simple Python code with Selenium Grid that performs the following operations:

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.desired_capabilities import DesiredCapabilities

try:
    deiver = webdriver.Remote(
        command_executor='http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub',
        desired_capabilities={'browserName': 'firefox', 'javascriptEnabled': True}
        )
except Exception as e:
    print("Error submitting form: ", e)

driver.get('http://www.python.org')
print("The test was done successfully")
driver.quit()

When I run the project it returns this error:
Error submitting form:  Message: Could not start a new session. New session request timed out 
Host info: host: 'leno-Lenovo-IdeaPad-L340-15API', ip: '127.0.1.1'
Build info: version: '4.10.0', revision: 'c14d967899'
System info: os.name: 'Linux', os.arch: 'amd64', os.version: '5.19.0-40-generic', java.version: '11.0.19'
Driver info: driver.version: unknown


The error message you are receiving indicates that there was a timeout while trying to start a new session with the Selenium Grid. This can happen for various reasons, such as incorrect configuration or connectivity issues. Here are a few things you can check to troubleshoot the issue:

    Make sure that the Selenium Grid is running and accessible at the specified address (http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub). Verify that the Grid hub is up and running by visiting http://127.0.0.1:4444/grid/console in your web browser.

    Check that the desired browser (firefox in your case) is available and registered with the Selenium Grid. You can check the available browsers and their statuses on the Selenium Grid console.

    Verify that the version of Selenium WebDriver you are using is compatible with the version of the Selenium Grid. It's important to ensure that the versions are compatible to avoid any compatibility issues.

    Ensure that there are no network or firewall restrictions preventing the communication between your code and the Selenium Grid. Check if any firewalls or security software on your machine are blocking the connection.

    Double-check that there are no typos or errors in the code or the URL you are trying to access (http://www.python.org). Make sure the URL is correct and accessible.

    Check the logs of the Selenium Grid and the Selenium Node (if applicable) for any additional error messages or warnings that may provide more insights into the issue.

By reviewing these points and addressing any potential issues, you should be able to resolve the "New session request timed out" error and successfully run your Selenium Grid code.
